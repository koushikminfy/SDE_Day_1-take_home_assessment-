//[Easy] Create two variables, numA and numB, and assign them number values. Write an if/else statement to print which number is larger or if they are equal.

const numA=10;
const numB=30;

if(numA>numB){
    console.log("number a is largher than number b");
}
else if(numA<numB){
    console.log("number b is larger than number a");
}
else{
    console.log("both numbers are equal");  
}
